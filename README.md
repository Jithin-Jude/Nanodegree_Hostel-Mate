# Capstone Project Stage 1 :- Hostel Mate

![cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20029287/45880101-75a83e00-bdc4-11e8-8415-429d2af7067d.JPG)

Why this Project?
-
Hostel Mate is basically a software based hostel management system. Currently, when an issue
found in the hostel (such as damaged bulbs, fans, windows etc.), we should reach
reception and report the issue in a register book. So, to report each issue student should travel
from their room to reception. Sometimes the receptionist will not be there so the student have to
wait for a long. I want to replace this conventional hostel issue reporting system with the help of
technology which helps to reduce the strain of the hostel staff and the inmates.

How to use Hostel Mate?
-
Each inmate in the hostel should register and login via google to use the facility. There should
be only one login for receptionist. For which, user name and password are default stored in firebase Real Time Database. Once the receptionist has logged with this user name and
password he can change that as he wanted.
After login when an issue found in hostel, student can take a photo of the issue (damaged bulb,
fans, windows etc.) add a description and location (room number and block in hostel) where the
issue found. Then submit the issue.
When an inmate submit an issue receptionist will get a notification so he can take the required
actions to fix the issue. Once the issue is fixed it will show as fixed in the app.

Notes for Reviewer
-
That was such a great review sir. I actually forgot to give you the receptionist login Username & Password in the previous submission.

Receptionist Login username : amaljyothi

Receptionist Login password : 777

I have tested the App in two of my friends' devices (Oreo/Lolipop). I can't find any issues with Inmates Login. I'm always able to log in and log out in both release and debug version.
